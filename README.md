# Network Optimization using SDN
Project from Advanced Computer Networks lecture at TUM

During the project our task was to analyze the impact of different bandwidth and latency levels on application layer protocols.

## Measurement Suite
First we implemented simple clients and servers for FTP, HTTP and SSH

## Mininet Topology
We created a topology using Mininet to test the communication protocols and plotted the results.

## Controlling the Traffic
Next we made some experiments with Openflows discovery feature using POX.

Be utilizing POX we defined different routes within our network topology to again test the communication protocols.
